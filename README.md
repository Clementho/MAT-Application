# MAT Capture: A Data Recording Platform for Wheelchair Presriptions

This repository contains a prototype internal tool developed to support Scope Australia's therapists in streamlining the Mechanical Assessment Tool (MAT) process. The MAT Capture applications aims to facilitate efficient evaluation of an individual's musculoskeletal system and provides a centralized platform for managing related workflows.


## About the Project
The MAT Capture prototype was created to modernize and support the MAT assessment process, enabling physiotherapists and occupational therapists at Scope Australia to perform more efficient, accurate, and structured evaluations. This digital solution transforms the traditional physical MAT assessment form into a dynamic, user-friendly digital interface.

The application was designed to deconstruct the complex assessment process into manageable sections while retaining the familiar format of data entry. The platform also serves as a guide, providing:
* Detailed Explanations and Visual Aids: Clear descriptions and images accompany each field of assessment, providing therapists with step-by-step support throughout the process.
* Visual Indicators and Color Coding: Intuitive feedback highlights the status of each field, enabling therapists to quickly identify progress, detect errors, or address incomplete sections.
* Autosave Functionality: Ensures data is saved automatically, allowing therapists to seamlessly resume assessments in the event of disruptions or reschedules.


## Key Features
* **Booking and Scheduling**: Simplifies the scheduling process, allowing Scope Australia administrative personnel to book MAT assessments efficiently through an intuitive interface.
* **Assessment Management**: Provides a streamlined system to conduct, access, and manage ongoing and upcoming MAT assessments.
* **Historical Records**: Allows users to access, view, and manage past MAT assessments for reference and analysis, supporting data-driven decisions and patient care.
* **Report Generation**: Generates detailed PDF reports of MAT assessments for documentation, sharing, and future reference.
* **Therapist Management**: Facilitates the management of therapists, including defining roles, responsibilities, and user access levels.
* **Digitalized Assessment Guidance**: Reflects a digital version of the physical MAT assessment form, complete with step-by-step guidance for various measurement phases and categories. This feature ensures therapists can follow a structured process with minimal oversight.
* **Intuitive Interface with Visual Feedback**: Incorporates visual indicators and appropriate color coding to notify users of the states of each assessment field. At a glance, users can monitor progress, identify errors, or spot incomplete sections, improving assessment accuracy and efficiency.
